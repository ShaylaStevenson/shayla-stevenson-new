            <p>
                I am a Full-stack Web Developer with experience building databases using Sequelize and Mongo, as well as JavaScript libraries including React.
                The skills that I am acquiring through my education at the Trilogy Full-stack Web Development program allow
                me to develop fully functioning, responsive web applications.
            </p>

                My mission is to work with local businesses to allow them professional representation in an online market. My background
                in business management provides me a unique perspective in web development. At the heart of my designs is the concept of the user's experience.
                Your employees and customers will use my sites intuitivly, which is achieved by efficient flow and navigation throughout the applications.

                Your website is your organization's home. As such, I want its guests to feel welcome and comfortable. Your website should represent your 
                businesses' unique message and style. The first stage in my design process is to get to know your brand in order to create a space that supports
                its mission. Then, through frequent colaboration, we can build the site that fits you.
